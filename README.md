# FRC-Cpp-Course

A basic introduction to C++ intended for Curtin FRC teams

FYI: THIS IS STILL A WORK IN PROGRESS

## Requirements

You can use any C++ IDE/editor and compiler to follow this course.

## Intentions

The decisions made in creating this course were made for a particular purpose. It is here that these decisions are elucidated for the good of the instructor. If the instructor understands the intent of the course, then he/she will be better suited to conduct the course.

The main goals of the course are to:
 - Teach computation: Software engineering is an interesting discipline in-and-of itself, but it's particular methods do not differ much from that of other engineering disciplines. Students will gain an appetite for the rigour and thought of engineering from other activities that heavily focus on process.

 This activity intends to provide insight into that which is unique to computing. Algorithms and the coercion of data this takes first position here.

 - Be entertaining: Attributes of the course that fail to satisfy the first (above) criteria, are (usually) in service of this criteria. There are tedious tasks in computing, as there are in any field. An attempt has been made to relate the tasks being completed to tasks that may be useful, or otherwise interesting, for the participants.

- Be achievable: Students coming in can only be assumed to have a certain competency level. Knowledge of C++ is not required to complete these tasks. However, if a reasonable amount of knowledge is required, then this will be emphatically noted.

In this course you will develop a general knowledge and understanding of software design and problem solving, as well as the basics of embedded programming, autonomous robot programming, computer communications, version control, testing and debugging.

## Audience

This course is primarily intended for students taking part in FRC, but can be applied to learners at a high-school level and above who are interested in computer science and are willing to learn.

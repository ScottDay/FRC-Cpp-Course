\begin{frame}[fragile]{Functions}
    In C++ we can subdivide the functional features of a program into blocks of code known as
    functions. In effect these are subprograms that can be used to avoid the repetition of similar
    code and allow complicated tasks to be broken down into parts, making the program modular. \newline

    Until now you have encountered programs where all the code (statements) has been written inside
    a single function called main(). Every executable C++ program has at least this function. In
    the next sections we will learn how to write additional functions.
